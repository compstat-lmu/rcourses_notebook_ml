# Machine Learning Usecase

To run it you can either:

1. run the Jupyter Notebook in your browser of choice (preferably Firefox/ Chrome) by simply clicking on this badge [![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://beta.mybinder.org/v2/gh/compstat-lmu/rcourses_notebook_ml/master?filepath=notebook_ml.ipynb)
2. fork the repo and run the notebook on your local machine via the bash command `cd <local repo> && jupyter notebook`. In this case, make sure that you already installed the required R packages `ggplot2`, `mlr` and `gbm`.
